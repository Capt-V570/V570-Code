# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts
# coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin,
# one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due.
# Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed.
# Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.


# Define the cost of a bottle of Coke in cents
COST = 50

    # Prompt the user to insert coins until the cost of a bottle of Coke is reached
